# NYC Historical Storefront Analysis

## Introduction
TBD

## Instructions
Given that the data pulls from multiple different sources of different formats, we have divided the code into segments that may be run separately. Instructions for each dataset are as follows:
### Pull from sources
#### DCA
In `/scrips/dca` run all the files labeled `..._src.py`
#### DOH
TBD
#### DOA
TBD
#### AES
TBD
### Merge
Run `/scrips/merge.py`.

## Notes
### global_vars.py
in order to use `global_vars.py` to handle imports, necessary global variables, and file paths, `global_vars.py` must be [added to the PYTHONPATH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3387695/add-to-python-path-mac-os-x).
